_Synopsis_: Technical leadership is above helping other people do their jobs well, **Facilitate**, **Advocate**, **Motivate** are the core goals of the technical leadership position and are integral in helping the team build good software while keeping the bigger picture in mind.

Additionally in this kind of role your output will not be what it is as a developer in terms of raw code 💻.

Things to be proactive about:
- Say **NO** to feature creep 🙈
- Write everything down and **send re-cap emails** 📨
- Remove roadblocks, or prevent them from ever happening (anticipation) ✌
- Know the answers, and ideally create a place where people know to look for them ❓
- Try to remove as much emotion from issues as possible by creating frameworks and data where no one feels personally responsible ([Burndown charts](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/burndown-charts) 📉 are seen as a good way to handle this)
- If you have concerns above the direction a developer is going, instead of trying to overrule them, whiteboard the problem and list your concerns as they explain their intended solution, this way you are able to voice concerns as well as get a better feel where the developer is in regards to the project 😇
