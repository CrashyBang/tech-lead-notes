_Synopsis_: Technical leadership is above helping other people do their jobs well, **Facilitate**, **Advocate**, **Motivate** are the core goals of the technical leadership position and are integral in helping the team build good software while keeping the bigger picture in mind.

Things to be proactive about:
- Say **NO** to feature creep
- Write everything down and **send re-cap emails** 📨
- Remove roadblocks, or prevent them from ever happening (anticipation) ✌
- Know the answers, and ideally create a place where people know to look for them ❓
- Try to remove as much emotion from issues as possible by creating frameworks and data where no one feels personally responsible ([Burndown charts](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/burndown-charts) 📉 are seen as a good way to handle this)
